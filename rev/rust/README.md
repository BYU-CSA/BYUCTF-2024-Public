I hope your rev skills aren't very rusty! But even if it is, I've got a perfect opportunity for you to keep them sharp!

## Writeup
It's a "simple" (for Rust) flag checker that adds 69 to the charcode of each character of the input and compares it to a static array. The flag length must also be 23 (including null byte). Even though it's Rust, it's pretty clear in the code what's going on. It's also stripped.

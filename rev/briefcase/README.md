# Deal or No Deal
Description:
```markdown
We made a game just like Deal or No Deal, but the briefcases are based on a string we gave it. Can't be any problems there!!

[briefcase]

## Writeup
You have to just work backwards from the end to find the solve. You can start with the furthest back and just find possible ways to work backwards until you find a solve. One way is to recreate the logic of the system and just brute force word by word.

# Water You Doing, Step-Eclipse?
Description:
```markdown
On April 7th, 2024 while visiting my parents, I took a walk to a local body of water. Sometime between 3:00PM and 3:30PM EST, I took some pictures of the scenery while sitting on a bench. Exactly 24 hours later, I took a picture of the Sun from the same bench.
Can you find the exact "what3words" location of the bench where I took the pictures?

IDK bro they kinda just have to do it. It's like a GeoGuessr-esque challenge. Not really any cheeses for this, they just have to deal with it. Anyway, the challenge makes use of https://what3words.com/.

The solution is one of these squares:

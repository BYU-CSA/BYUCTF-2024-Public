With some research, you can find the crown belongs to the British Postal Service. You can then look at all locations that would have a Stanley in them. This will be more tricky as initial results will only show matches within the UK mainland. They will have to broaden their search to British overseas territories to find Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.
